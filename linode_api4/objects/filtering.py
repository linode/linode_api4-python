.. module:: linode

Collections returned by the :any:`LinodeClient` can be filtered using a
SQLAlchemy-like syntax.  When calling any "get" method of the :any:`LinodeClient`
class of one of its groups, any number of filters may be passed in as boolean
comparisons between attributes of the model returned by the collection.

For example, calling :any:`instances` returns a list of :any:`Instance`
objects, so we can use properties of :any:`Instance` to filter the results::

   # returns all Instances in the "prod" group
   client.linode.instances(Instance.group == "prod")

You can use any boolean comparisons when filtering collections::

   # returns all Instances _not_ in us-east-1a
   client.linode.instances(Instance.region != "us-east-1a")

You can combine filters to be even more specific - by default all filters are
considered::

   # returns all Instances in the "prod" group that are in us-east-1a
   client.linode.instances(Instance.group == "prod",
                               Instance.region == "us-east-1a")

If you need to combine the results of two filters, you can use :any:`or_` to define
this relationship::

   # returns all Instance in either the "prod" or "staging" groups
   client.linode.instances(or_(Instance.group == "prod",
                                   Instance.group == "staging"))

:any:`and_` is also available in case you need to do deeply-nested comparisons::

   # returns all Instances in the group "staging" and any Instances in the "prod"
   # group that are located in "us-east-1a"
   client.linode.instances(or_(Instance.group == "staging",
                                   and_(Instance.group == "prod",
                                        Instance.region == "us-east-1a"))
